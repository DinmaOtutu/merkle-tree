## Introduction

Blockchain technology, is a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered.
However, with the massive volume of transactions and the distributed nature of the network, ensuring swift verification of data presents a significant challenge.

Imagine having to verify the authenticity of a single transaction within a block of thousands, or checking the integrity of a file in a massive dataset. This is where Merkle trees and Merkle proofs come into play. Providing a simplified process by summarizing all the transactions into a single hash, the Merkle root, which serves as a compact representation of the entire dataset. 

Through Merkle proofs, it is possible to verify any single transaction without needing to download the entire blockchain, thereby ensuring security and efficiency.
